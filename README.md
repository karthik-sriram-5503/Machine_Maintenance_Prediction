## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The process ensured the dataset was suitable for model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed insightful patterns in the data. Visualizations created using Seaborn and Matplotlib are available in the 'notebooks' directory.

## Modeling

The decision tree classifier was chosen due to its interpretability. The model was trained on [training set size] instances and evaluated using [testing set size]. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was assessed using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
